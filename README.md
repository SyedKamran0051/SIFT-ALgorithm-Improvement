The SIFT algorithm (Scale Invariant Feature Transform) proposed by Lowe [1]
is an approach for extracting distinctive invariant features from images. It has
been successfully applied to a variety of computer vision problems based on
feature matching including object recognition, pose estimation, image
retrieval and many others. However, in real-world applications there is still a
need for improvement of the algorithmâ€™s robustness with respect to the
correct matching of SIFT features.
an improvement of the
original SIFT algorithm providing more reliable feature matching for the
purpose of object recognition is proposed.
